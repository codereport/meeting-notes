### Notes

* So Marshall informs me of this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:J_(programming_language)#FP_and_FL

>  Iverson and Eugene McDonnell's "Phrasal Forms" points out the similarity but also indicates that Backus's forms were used in APL as early as 1962, well before his Turing Award lecture in 1978

and I was like ... whaaatttttt. Clearly I need to go read this paper again. And sure enough

If you go to that paper ... sure enough:

and you can find a better desciprtion in Curry and Feys 1958

all of which I have captured this tweet: https://twitter.com/code_report/status/1508989754083364866?s=20&t=2z9jmNOc_Q3_K6bZKKbPjg

So it seems S' used to be known as Î¦ and was named in 1931!!! Which makes it very clear that J didn't take the fork from infix notation in FP, it came from combinatory logic. So Marshall definitely seems right. The similarities between FP and APL are definitely more from APL -> FP.
