### Notes

* gates dropped out of harvard, the micro computer was going to be the next big thing. went on a tour of USA & Canada - he visited IPSA... Ian Sharp met with Gates, 
Iverson got invited in - we thought Gates was onto something - but they had there hands full with time sharing ... PC came out 2 years later - 
made the 5100 obsolete - BASIC was easier to get performant compared to APL on these PCs
* J digraphs can be just as expressive
* J has far more primitives than APL
