### Notes

* https://code.jsoftware.com/wiki/System/Forums
* Ken was a grad student alongside Fred Brooks at Harvard
* Iverson & Brooks co-authored Automatic Data Processing (used APL aka Iverson Notation)

Eric Iverson
* summers in high school i worked for IBM
* IvSys very very early verson of APL, selectric typewriter
* fortuitously, IBM came out with the IBM Selectric Typewriter
* the golfball had enought for upper and lower, bumbers ... sort of ASCII characters
* APL sacrificed lowercase alphabets, replaced lowercase with APL symbols
* Dad will always have friends over for dinner and bbqs - always talking about the character set
* The hot topic became overstrikes
* "Words are what the application designed should be doing - we should be doing symbols"
* Just as much care was put into the J character set
   * Much more freedom starting with the ASCII character set
   * Double dot had no meaning in APL unil ~1985, ~ was added to J ... then commute 
 * IPSA and IBM2 had huge fights between each other
 * Dyalog APL and JSoftware

~1960 left harvard and moved to NY to work at IBM
  - year Eric started high school
~ summer of 11 & 12 grade Eric worked at the IBM research center (this was 1964/65)
IBM\360 -> made it really possible to have a great APL implementation
Fred Brooks was one of the key people to make IBM 360 possible
- for decades ruled computing
Brooks was a senior individual working on the architecture of the 360
Ken and Falkolff worked on was the 360 description

Elementary Function
- box arrow diagrams in this book was used to model the IBM 360

civil rights
anti-vietman war
american draft board

so ended up going to Canada

IPSharp start at 1968 as employee #9 - Ian Sharp put him on APL project
- 1st project minicomputer 1130 (vague relative of the IBM360) i worked with a sr consultant to implment an apl for 1130
- 2nd project made a version of APL\360 that ran on more restricted hardward (no 64 bit, only 32 bit)
- Ian Sharp went into the time sharing businees, 360 had a bunch of different models: IBM model 50 (there was 30, 70, etc)
- 1971 is when IP Sharp leased the model 50
- Eric went to Yale
- registered aliens when living in New York - registered aliens were eligle for draft

- when I (Eric) i am doing this or that, Ken just provided opportunities 
- dad was totally on board when Eric wanted nothing to do with computers
- Roger Moore (from Stanford) - went and worked at IBM ... he ended up going to Canada for different reasons (IPSA #3)
- Ken new Roger, which is how Ken hooked Eric up with a job in IP Sharp

1988/9 you could buy a PC and started working on an implementatino of that
Ken & Roger were working on J.
Started a company Iverson Software

this is a complicated 

IBM first came out with the PC - wanted to get APL running on it - our APL was all in 360 assembler instructions - about that time - accelerator board
accelerator board + pc for APL is a non-starter
IPSharp built an emulator on IBM PC 8086 for 360. It ran pretty fast - it ran fast for faster than any other upstart APLs for PC. 
When i left IPSA in 87, the 360 emulator and Sharp APL on native IBM PC. slowly take code from 360 emulator/Sharp APL and coding it in 8086 ...
Starting spending more time with Ken and Roger who were writing J
